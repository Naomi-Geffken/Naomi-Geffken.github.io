	<h1>Hi there, I'm Naomi!</h1>
	<p><b>[Under Development]</b> My hope is to build this space to reflect the current things I'm making and learning---<em>Projects,
		Work, and self-directed learning.</em> I'm currently enrolled in Algorithms and Intro to Data-Science and will be taking
		a database management course, Assembly Languages, and a HCI courses in the Spring. I'm especially enjoying learning about and 
		solving algorithmic and complexity-based problems. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
	<p>My current goal is to practice, practice, practice  as my current code is quite ugly in my opinion.</p>
