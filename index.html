	<h1>Hi there, I'm Naomi!</h1>
	<h3>[This site is under initial development]</h3>
	<p>My hope is to build this space to reflect the current things I'm making and learning---<em>Projects,
		Work, Classes, and self-directed learning.</em> I'm currently enrolled in Algorithms and Intro to Data-Science and will be taking
		a Database Management, Assembly Languages, and a HCI courses in the Spring. I'm especially enjoying learning about and 
		solving algorithmic and complexity-based problems.</p>
	<p>My current goal is to practice, practice, practice writing less ugly code. I build a project, reflect, get feedback, rewrite, reflect, get feedback, rewrite, and repeat with a new project.</p>
